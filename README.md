# FileWatcher
The goal of this project is to provide a wrapper for the C# FileSystemWatcher, which has more visibility of the buffer. This would include things like "buffer_empty" events that would be triggered when file operations ceased.

This has a secondhand goal being a way for me to learn and practice more with event driven programming and event handling.
